# MATLAB-Simon-Task
The Simon task is an experimental paradigm where irrelevant spatial cues have been shown to influence the response times (RTs) 
of participants. The task involves participants responding to non-spatial aspects of stimuli (e.g., colours) 
by pressing response keys on the left and right. They are also asked to ignore the physical position of where the stimulus is presented on the screen. 
In this way, the participants are essentially processing one dimension of a stimulus whilst ignoring the other, thus inducing the ‘Simon effect’. 
The Simon effect suggests that the location of a stimulus can directly influence one’s decision-making due to the propensity to respond towards the 
source of the stimulus. Explanations for the Simon effect usually imply that there is an impediment that occurs in the response-selection stage of decision making. 
It is widely expected that the Simon task will suggest that a stimulus’ location is difficult to ignore and will therefore increase RTs and reduce accuracy rates, 
even if the participant is made aware that the location of the stimulus is irrelevant.
